# Health Check CI/CD Pipeline Summary

A CI/CD pipeline that waits for Amplify to auto-deploy changes and then verifies the deployment with health checks, with PR status gating.

## 🎯 What We Built

1. **Health Check Script** (`health-check.js`)
   - Simple Playwright-based verification
   - Checks MSW functionality and transaction data
   - Generates screenshots for debugging
   - CLI-friendly with various options

2. **Wait and Verify Workflow** (`.github/workflows/wait-and-verify-deployment.yml`)
   - **Waits for Amplify deployment** (from your `amplify.yml`)
   - **Health check automation** after deployment
   - **PR status updates** based on health check results
   - **PR blocking** if health check fails

3. **NPM Scripts** (in `package.json`)
   - `npm run health-check` - Test production
   - `npm run health-check:local` - Test local development

## 🚀 How It Works

### **Complete Pipeline Flow**
```
Code Push/PR → Amplify auto-deploys (from amplify.yml) → Wait for completion → Health Check → PR Status Updated
                                    ↓
                              If Health Check Fails → PR Fails ❌
                              If Health Check Passes → PR Passes ✅
```

### **Key Points**
- **Amplify handles deployment** automatically from your `amplify.yml`
- **This workflow only waits and verifies** - it doesn't control deployment
- **Health checks run after deployment** to ensure everything works
- **PR status is updated** based on verification results

## 🎯 Benefits

### **For Developers**
- ✅ **Automatic verification** - Every deployment is automatically tested
- ✅ **PR safety** - Can't merge broken deployments
- ✅ **Clear feedback** - Know immediately if deployment is healthy
- ✅ **Screenshots** - Visual debugging when things go wrong

### **For Quality Assurance**
- ✅ **Deployment verification** - Every change is automatically tested
- ✅ **Regression prevention** - Broken deployments block PRs
- ✅ **Audit trail** - Complete history of deployments and health checks
- ✅ **Fast feedback** - Issues caught before they reach production

## 🔧 Setup Required

### **1. Branch Protection Rules**
Set up branch protection in GitHub to require the health check:
1. Go to Settings → Branches → Add rule
2. Select `main` branch
3. Check "Require status checks to pass before merging"
4. Add "Wait and Verify Deployment" as required status check

### **2. Workflow Configuration**
- **Deployment Wait**: 4 minutes (adjust if needed)
- **Target URL**: Your embedded finance demo URL
- **Timeout**: 15 minutes total

## 🧪 Testing During PR Development

### **Local Testing**
```bash
# Test against production
npm run health-check

# Test against local development
npm run dev  # Terminal 1
npm run health-check:local  # Terminal 2
```

### **PR Testing**
1. **Push changes** - Workflow automatically starts
2. **Watch pipeline** - Check Actions tab for progress
3. **Monitor deployment** - See when Amplify starts building
4. **Wait for health check** - Pipeline waits for deployment completion
5. **Check PR status** - PR will show success/failure
