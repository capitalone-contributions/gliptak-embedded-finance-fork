# Health Check Setup Summary

A simple, focused health check system for the embedded finance demo.

## 🎯 What We Built

1. **Health Check Script** (`health-check.js`)

   - Simple Playwright-based verification
   - Checks MSW functionality and transaction data
   - Generates screenshots for debugging
   - CLI-friendly with various options

2. **GitHub Action** (`.github/workflows/simple-health-check.yml`)

   - Runs automatically on main branch pushes
   - Manual trigger option for testing
   - Uploads screenshots as artifacts
   - Provides clear pass/fail results

3. **NPM Scripts** (in `package.json`)
   - `npm run health-check` - Test production
   - `npm run health-check:local` - Test local development

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Developers

```bash
# Test locally before pushing
cd app/client-next-ts
npm run health-check

# Test against local dev server
npm run dev  # Terminal 1
npm run health-check:local  # Terminal 2
```

### For GitHub Actions

- **Automatic**: Runs on every push to main
- **Manual**: Go to Actions tab → Run workflow
- **Results**: Check Actions tab for screenshots and logs

## ✅ What It Verifies

- Demo page loads without errors
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) is working
- Transaction data is accessible
- No critical JavaScript errors
- Generates screenshots for debugging

## 🧹 Cleanup Done

- Removed complex, multi-environment workflows
- Removed unnecessary configuration files
- Removed verbose documentation
- Kept only essential, focused files

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Test locally to ensure it works
2. Push changes to trigger the workflow
3. Monitor results in GitHub Actions
4. Use for post-deployment verification

**Simple, focused, and effective!** 🎉
