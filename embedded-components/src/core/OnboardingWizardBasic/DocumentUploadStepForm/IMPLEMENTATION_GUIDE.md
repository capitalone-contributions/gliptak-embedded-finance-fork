# Implementing an Incremental Document Upload Experience

## Overview

The document upload process can be complex when multiple document types are required with various conditional requirements. To simplify this experience for users, we recommend implementing an incremental requirement evaluation approach that dynamically reveals requirements as previous ones are satisfied.

## User Experience Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI
    participant API
    
    API->>UI: Document request with requirements
    UI->>User: Display initial requirement
    
    Note over User,UI: Only the first requirement is shown initially
    
    User->>UI: Select document type
    User->>UI: Upload document
    UI->>API: Upload document
    API->>UI: Confirm upload
    
    Note over UI: Re-evaluate requirements
    
    UI->>User: Display next requirement if applicable
    
    User->>UI: Select additional document type
    User->>UI: Upload another document
    UI->>API: Upload document
    API->>UI: Confirm upload
    
    Note over UI: All requirements satisfied
    
    User->>UI: Submit documents
    UI->>API: Submit document request
    API->>UI: Confirm submission
    UI->>User: Show completion message
```

## Incremental Requirement Evaluation

The core of this approach is revealing requirements only when they become relevant, reducing cognitive load for users.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Load Document Request] --> B[Show First Requirement]
    B --> C{User Uploads Document}
    C --> D[Re-evaluate Requirements]
    D --> E{All Requirements Met?}
    E -- Yes --> F[Enable Submit]
    E -- No --> G{Need Additional Requirement?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Show Next Requirement]
    G -- No --> C
    H --> C
    F --> I[Submit Documents]
```

## User Interface States

The UI transitions through several states during the document upload process:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> InitialState
    
    state InitialState {
        [*] --> ShowingFirstRequirement
    }
    
    InitialState --> UploadingDocuments: User selects document type
    
    state UploadingDocuments {
        [*] --> DocumentTypeSelected
        DocumentTypeSelected --> FileUploaded: User uploads file
    }
    
    UploadingDocuments --> RequirementEvaluation: Document uploaded
    
    state RequirementEvaluation {
        [*] --> CheckingRequirements
        CheckingRequirements --> CalculatingActiveRequirements
        CalculatingActiveRequirements --> UpdatedRequirementList
    }
    
    RequirementEvaluation --> ShowingAdditionalRequirement: More requirements needed
    RequirementEvaluation --> SubmissionReady: All requirements met
    
    ShowingAdditionalRequirement --> UploadingDocuments: User continues upload
    
    SubmissionReady --> SubmittingDocuments: User clicks submit
    SubmittingDocuments --> DocumentRequestComplete: Submission successful
    
    DocumentRequestComplete --> [*]
```

## Implementation Considerations

When implementing this incremental approach, consider the following:

1. **Visual Progress Indicators**: Show users which requirements have been satisfied and which remain.
   
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Document Request"
        A[Requirement 1] --> |Completed| B[Requirement 2]
        B --> |In Progress| C[Requirement 3]
        C --> |Not Started| D[Requirement 4]
    end
    
    style A fill:#c8e6c9,stroke:#43a047
    style B fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#fbc02d
    style C fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#9e9e9e
    style D fill:#f5f5f5,stroke:#9e9e9e,stroke-dasharray: 5 5
```

2. **Document Type Selection**: Only offer document types that are valid for the current requirement and haven't already been satisfied.

3. **Contextual Guidance**: Provide clear instructions for each requirement as it becomes active.

4. **Validation Feedback**: Offer immediate feedback on file type, size, and quality.

By implementing this incremental approach, you can simplify a complex document collection process, guiding users through requirements step-by-step and reducing errors and confusion.
