# Implementing an Incremental Document Upload Experience

## Overview

The document upload process can be simplified by using an incremental approach that guides users through requirements step-by-step, while still providing visibility of the overall process.

## User Flow with Client-Side State Management

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant UI Display
    participant UI State
    participant API
    
    API->>UI Display: Load document request with all requirements
    Note over UI Display: Show all requirements, but only first is interactive
    UI Display->>User: Display all requirements (first active, others disabled)
    
    User->>UI Display: Select document type & upload for first requirement
    UI Display->>UI State: Update satisfied requirements
    UI State->>UI Display: Re-evaluate active requirements
    UI Display->>API: Upload document (async)
    
    Note over UI State: Client-side requirement evaluation
    
    UI State->>UI Display: Activate next requirement
    UI Display->>User: Enable interaction with next requirement
    
    User->>UI Display: Select document type & upload for next requirement
    UI Display->>UI State: Update satisfied requirements
    UI State->>UI Display: Re-evaluate active requirements
    UI Display->>API: Upload document (async)
    
    UI State->>UI Display: All requirements satisfied
    UI Display->>User: Enable submission
    User->>UI Display: Submit all documents
    UI Display->>API: Submit document request
```

## Implementation Note

The recommended approach manages requirements as UI state:

- All requirements are visible to the user from the beginning, showing the complete picture
- Only the currently active requirement(s) are interactive (enabled for document type selection and file upload)
- As requirements are satisfied, the UI state updates locally, without needing server confirmation
- Previously completed requirements show confirmation indicators
- Next requirements become interactive in sequence as previous ones are completed
- Document uploads happen asynchronously without blocking the UI
- Final submission occurs only when all requirements are satisfied

This pattern gives users visibility of the entire process while guiding them through each step in a controlled manner, creating a more intuitive experience.
