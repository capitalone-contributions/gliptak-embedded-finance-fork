## Design Philosophy Alignment

This component follows the Embedded UI Components design philosophy outlined in the main README.md:

### Integration Scenarios and Use Cases

The LinkedAccountWidget component is designed for flexible integration into parent web applications, offering several customization points:

- **Runtime Customization**: Inject design tokens to match parent app's theme, override content tokens from parent app's CMS systems, connect to parent app's monitoring via `userEventsHandler`
- **Component Configuration**: Configure API endpoints via provider, customize component behavior through props
- **Client ID Management**: Requires client ID to be provided by parent application (cannot create clients)
- **Variant Support**: Supports both default (multi-account) and singleAccount variants for different use cases

### OpenAPI Specification (OAS) & Code Generation

**IMPORTANT**: This component is built using the latest available OpenAPI Specification (OAS) from the JPMC API Portal. The implementation follows the automated code generation approach:

1. **OAS as Source of Truth**: The OpenAPI Specification defines API contracts and types
2. **Automated Code Generation**: Orval generates from OAS:
   - TypeScript interfaces
   - Type-safe React Query hooks
   - API client utilities
3. **Type Consistency**: Ensures type consistency between API and UI
4. **Opinionated Layer**: Built using generated types and hooks with an opinionated layer providing:
   - Enhanced client validations based on API specifications
   - Smart payload formation
   - Error mapping & recovery
   - UX optimizations implemented based on best practices

### Key Principles

- **OAS-Driven Development**: All API interactions are based on the latest OAS from the JPMC API Portal
- **Type Safety**: Generated TypeScript types ensure compile-time safety
- **Automated Hooks**: React Query hooks are generated automatically from OAS
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error mapping based on API specifications
- **Smart UX**: Intelligent navigation, field prepopulation, and cognitive load reduction
- **Microdeposit Verification**: Specialized workflow for account verification through microdeposits

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture & Data Models (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Technology Stack Selection

- **Frontend Framework**: Choose between React, Vue, Angular, or vanilla JavaScript
- **State Management**: Implement appropriate state management (Redux, Vuex, Zustand, or custom)
- **Form Management**: Select form library (React Hook Form, Formik, VeeValidate, or custom)
- **Validation**: Implement validation strategy (Zod, Yup, Joi, or custom)
- **UI Framework**: Choose UI component library or build custom components
- **HTTP Client**: Select HTTP client (Axios, Fetch API, or framework-specific)
- **Testing**: Choose testing framework (Jest, Vitest, or framework-specific)

#### 1.2 Client ID Requirements

- **Required Client ID**: Component requires client ID to be provided by parent application
- **No Client Creation**: Component cannot create clients (only onboarding flow can create clients)
- **Client ID Validation**: Validate that client ID is provided before making API calls
- **Error Handling**: Display appropriate error if client ID is missing

#### 1.3 OAS-Based Code Generation Setup

- **OpenAPI Specification**: Use the latest OAS from JPMC API Portal for recipients endpoints
- **Code Generation Tool**: Implement Orval or similar tool for automated code generation
- **Generated Types**: TypeScript interfaces for Recipient, RecipientRequest, UpdateRecipientRequest
- **Generated Hooks**: React Query hooks for CRUD operations (useCreateRecipient, useAmendRecipient, useGetAllRecipients, useRecipientsVerification)
- **API Client**: Generated HTTP client with proper authentication and error handling

#### 1.4 Data Model Implementation

**Note**: The following data models should be generated from the latest OAS specification. These are examples based on the current API structure:

```typescript
// Generated from OAS - Linked Account types
interface Recipient {
  id: string;
  type: 'LINKED_ACCOUNT';
  status:
    | 'ACTIVE'
    | 'MICRODEPOSITS_INITIATED'
    | 'REJECTED'
    | 'READY_FOR_VALIDATION'
    | 'INACTIVE';
  clientId: string;
  createdAt: string;
  updatedAt: string;
  partyDetails: PartyDetails;
  partyId: string;
  account: AccountDetails;
}

interface PartyDetails {
  type: 'INDIVIDUAL' | 'ORGANIZATION';
  firstName?: string;
  lastName?: string;
  businessName?: string;
  alternativeName?: string;
  address?: Address;
  contacts: Contact[];
}

interface AccountDetails {
  type: 'CHECKING' | 'SAVINGS';
  number: string;
  countryCode: string;
  bankName?: string;
  routingInformation: RoutingInfo[];
}

// Generated from OAS - API request/response types
interface RecipientRequest {
  // Generated from OAS specification
}

interface UpdateRecipientRequest {
  // Generated from OAS specification
}

## 1. Overview

The Linked Accounts Management Embedded Component enables users to link and manage their external bank accounts for use within the embedded finance application. This component provides functionality for creating, viewing, editing, and deactivating linked accounts, as well as verifying accounts through microdeposits when necessary.

Linked accounts (type: LINKED_ACCOUNT) represent external bank accounts belonging to the user or their organization that can be used as sources for payments. These accounts must be verified before they can be used for financial transactions.
