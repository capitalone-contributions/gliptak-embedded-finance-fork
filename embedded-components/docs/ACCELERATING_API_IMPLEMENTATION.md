# Accelerating API Implementation: From Calls to Workflows

In the world of APIs, individual calls rarely stand alone. More often, business capabilities require a series of steps - a workflow. The Digital Onboarding APIs, for instance, offer powerful tools for managing digital processes. But how can API providers help consumers create user-friendly, efficient experiences tailored to their specific business needs? Let's explore several techniques that can accelerate implementation and deliver value faster.

## 1. Fully Hosted UI Solutions

For the quickest path to value, API providers can offer fully hosted UI solutions. These turnkey options handle infrastructure, security, and user interface, allowing consumers to integrate complete, production-ready components with minimal effort.

**Key Benefit:** Dramatically reduced implementation time and risk.

## 2. Runtime UI Injection

For more flexibility, providers can offer runtime UI injection methods:
- iframes for easy embedding
- Server-side composition for seamless integration
- Client-side composition (e.g., module federation) for dynamic, performant experiences

**Key Benefit:** Balance between ease of implementation and customization.

## 3. Embedded UI Components

Publishing UI components as npm packages allows for build-time integration. This approach offers deep customization while still providing pre-built, tested components.

**Key Benefit:** Customizable UI with reduced development overhead.

## 4. UI/UX Cookbooks

Detailed, human-readable guidelines for implementing web applications can significantly speed up development. These cookbooks should include:
- Flow diagrams
- Sequence diagrams
- Best practices and code samples

**Key Benefit:** Clear roadmap for custom implementations, reducing design and architecture time.

## 5. Machine-Readable Specifications

Specifications like Arazzo provide a structured way to describe complex workflows and their underlying APIs. These machine-readable formats open up exciting possibilities:

- Automated code generation for basic implementations
- Integration with LLMs to quickly produce skeleton/draft versions of digital experiences
- Framework-agnostic approach, allowing generation for any UI library or custom instruction set

**Key Benefit:** Rapid prototyping and reduced boilerplate coding.

## Putting It All Together: The Digital Onboarding Example

Consider a digital onboarding process. An API provider could offer:

1. A fully hosted solution for immediate implementation
2. Embeddable components for key steps (e.g., ID verification)
3. A detailed cookbook outlining the entire workflow
4. An Arazzo specification describing the process structure

This multi-faceted approach allows API consumers to choose the implementation method that best fits their needs, timeline, and resources.

By providing these accelerators, API providers do more than just offer endpoints – they become partners in their consumers' success. This approach reduces implementation time, lowers the barrier to entry, and ultimately helps businesses get to value faster in today's competitive digital landscape.
