## shadcn/ui Instructions

Use the latest version of Shadcn to install new components, like this command to
add a button component:

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Quick Start

1. Run development server: `npm run dev`
2. Server runs on `localhost:3000`
3. Use path aliases: `@/components/ui/component`
4. Static assets go in `public/` with absolute paths
