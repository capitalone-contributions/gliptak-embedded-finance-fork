# PRD: Embedded Finance and Solutions Showcase

---

## 1. Vision  
Enable prospective partners and developers to explore JPMorgan Chase’s Embedded Payments APIs via a lightweight, polished web showcase.  
- Demonstrate end-to-end flows (KYC onboarding, bank account linking, transactions list and details, make a payment) in various marketplace contexts (e.g. “SellSense”).  
- Surface core UI components, theming, tone and copy-code snippets.  
- Drive faster time-to-value on our API products.

## 2. Personas  
- **API-first Developer**  
  Quickly scans component previews, copies code snippets and understands integration points.   
- **Technical Product Sponsor**  
  Reviews branding, tone, theming and overall UX before presenting to partners.
- **AI agents**  
  Explore extended API workflow scenarios.

## 3. Goals & Success Criteria  
- **Clarity of value:** Visitor clicks “View Demo” without any sign-up friction.  
- **API literacy:** Every component links back to its API reference at  
  `developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/api/embedded-finance-solutions/embedded-payments/overview`.  
- **Copy-code rate:** ≥ 90% of UI examples include a “Copy Code” button and research-doc link.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1 In-Scope  
- **Landing Page** (anonymous):  
  - Hero section + “View Demo” CTA → `/demo`  
  - List of demo scenarios with brief descriptions
  - Carousel of API workflow recipes (e.g. onboarding, linked accounts, transactions list and details, make a payment)
  - Small utility components gallery:
    - ImportantDateSelector  
    - IndustryClassification (NAICS)  
    - TaxIDSelector
- **Demo Scenario Portals** (`/demo`):  
  - Mocked API responses with optional stateful behavior
  - Ability to switch between scenarios, themes, and tones
  - Persistence of the scenario, theme, and tone selection in the URL
  - Code snippets for each component
- **Theming & Tone**: built-in themes + extensibility pattern; content tokens for “Standard” vs “Industry-specific” voice  
- **Mock API**: client-side only, stateful via MSW service worker; no persistence  
- **Docs links**: each preview links to its `ANALYSIS.md` or API spec  
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard & screen-reader support

### 4.2 Out-of-Scope
- Real backend or data persistence  
- Real authentication against identity provider  
- Analytics, logging, monitoring  
- Localization beyond English; no RTL

## 5. Functional Requirements
 TBD

## 6. Theming & Tone  
- **Built-in themes (examples):**  
  - Default Blue  
  - S&P Theme  
  - SellSense Theme  
  - PayFicient Theme  
  - “Add Your Own” extension pattern (see theming docs)  
- Themes defined via JSON token sets; onboarding guide in repo  
- **Tone variants:** driven by content tokens; demonstrate “Standard” vs “Industry-specific” voice

## 7. Mock API & Data  
- MSW service worker with predefined fixtures keyed by scenario  
- Data shapes and sample payloads cross-linked to the API overview at  
  `developer.payments.jpmorgan.com/api/embedded-finance-solutions/embedded-payments/overview`

## 8. Accessibility  
- Must meet WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast, focus indicators, ARIA roles  
- Full keyboard support for dialogs, carousels, dropdowns

## 9. Constraints & Assumptions  
- No persistent backend; all state in-memory via service worker  
- Single-page app with routes `/` and `/demo`  
- English only; no RTL support  
- Senior engineer + AI agents generate code artifacts
